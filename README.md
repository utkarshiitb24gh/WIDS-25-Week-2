# WIDS-25-MID TERM REPORT
# Project:Study of Models(ID:01)
I learnt about use and how to plot various kinds of  plots,histograms in order to visualise given data, next thing i learnt is
about correlation matrix, why is it used and its application and visulaisation, also learnt some basic functionalities
like describe.(),.head(),.info() etc
Next thing i learnt is using plots for identifying outliers. 
Then visualising our Housing price data using scatter plot and the data which was originally of California when plotted on scatter plot
based on the latitude, longitude and median house value it was in shape of California, and this was very pleasing.
Then we learn about preprocessing imputer and Scaling, preprocessing is refining our data so that we have best part of it remaining to train 
and imputer is used to encode missing values, we used standard scaler for scaling, this basically brings all of the numerical features on the
same scale (example: (0,1)) then we built pipeline which had these three transformations and then we applied that to our data.
Then we split our data in two parts using train and test split and model we used for training our data was Linear Regression.
After model got trained we plot the predicted values and actual values on graphs as well as we also find out mean square error
ans mean absolute error.
We noticed that most of the points in our predicted vs acutal values scatter plots were concentrated around line y=x(actual=predicted).
Where as some were very much away from the line.
Thank You
